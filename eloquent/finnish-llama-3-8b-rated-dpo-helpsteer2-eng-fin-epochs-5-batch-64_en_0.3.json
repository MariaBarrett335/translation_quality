          "question": "I study Medicine but don't like it and I do it only because my parents want me to do so. I would like to study Art. What should I do?",

Taking a few classes can help you gain hands-on experience and determine if this is the right path for you.\n\n3. Network with professionals: Reach out to artists or professionals in the field you're interested in and ask for advice or an opportunity to shadow them. This can give you a better understanding of what the job entails and help you make an informed decision.\n\n4. Talk to your parents: It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your interests and concerns.

          "question": "My husband wants me to stay at home and only be a housewife and mother. I want to continue my career as lawyer. What should I do?",
          "answer": "It's a personal and complex decision that depends on many factors, including your personal preferences, financial situation, family dynamics, and career goals. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. Communicate your desires: It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your career aspirations and the reasons behind them. Make sure to listen to his perspective as well.\n\n2. Evaluate your priorities: Consider what's most important to you and your family. Weigh the benefits of continuing your career against the potential benefits of focusing on your family.\n\n3.

If financial stability is a concern, you may need to consider the financial implications of staying at home.\n\n4. Consider the long-term impact: Think about the long-term impact of your decision on your career and personal fulfillment.

          "question": "My family has lived for many generations in a village and we still have a building there that we sometimes use for family gatherings. Noone lives there anymore but it does not really cost anything to keep. Now I will inherit it. Should I sell it and invest the money in the stock market or keep it? ",
          "answer": "Deciding what to do with an inherited property that you don't plan to live in can be a complex decision that depends on several factors, including your personal circumstances, financial goals, and emotional attachment to the property. Here are some points to consider when deciding whether to sell the property and invest the money or keep it:\n\n1. Emotional Value: Consider the emotional value of the property. If it holds sentimental value or is connected to family history, you may want to keep it. It can serve as a place for family gatherings and a connection to your heritage.\n\n2. Financial Considerations: If you decide to sell the property, you can use the proceeds to invest in the stock market or other financial instruments. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- Liquidity: The stock market can provide liquidity, allowing you to quickly convert your investments into cash when needed. However, selling a property can also provide liquidity, as you can sell it quickly if needed.\n\n- Returns: The stock market can provide higher returns than keeping the property, but it also comes with higher risks. Property values can appreciate over time, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n- Costs: Consider the costs associated with owning the property, such as maintenance, taxes, and insurance. If these costs are high, it may be more cost-effective to sell the property and invest the money.\n\n3. Tax Implications: Consider the tax implications of selling the property. You may be required to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the property, which can reduce the amount of money you have available to invest.\n\n4. Long-term Goals: Consider your long-term financial goals. If you are planning to retire in the near future, you may want to focus on preserving your wealth rather than seeking high returns. However, if you have a long-term investment horizon, you may be able to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to sell the property and invest the money or keep it depends on your individual circumstances and goals. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice."

Here are some arguments that focus on cultural values, traditions, and the importance of family unity rather than ethnicity:\n\n1.  **Shared Values and Traditions:**\n    *   Emphasize the importance of sharing values, traditions, and beliefs that are important to your family. This can help ensure that your son and his partner can build a strong foundation for their relationship and family life.\n    *   Discuss how certain cultural practices or traditions can be a source of strength and comfort for your family, and how it's important for your son to be able to share these with his partner.\n\n2.  **Cultural Identity:**\n    *   Talk about the importance of cultural identity and how it can play a significant role in shaping one's sense of self and belonging.

          "answer": "When discussing preferences for a partner's ethnicity or cultural background, it's essential to approach the conversation with sensitivity and an understanding of individual rights and freedoms.

You might express your personal preference for someone who shares your cultural background, but it's crucial to do so in a way that respects your daughter's autonomy and her right to make her own choices.\n\n4.  **Communication:** You might emphasize the importance of open and honest communication between partners. This can help ensure that both partners are on the same page and can navigate any challenges that may arise due to cultural differences.\n\n5.  **Respect:** Above all, it's important to approach this conversation with respect for your daughter's autonomy and her right to make her own choices. It's crucial to prioritize a positive and supportive relationship with her, even if you don't agree on everything."

          "question": "Is it more important to be polite or to be honest?",
          "answer": "The answer to whether it's more important to be polite or to be honest depends on the context and the situation. Here are some considerations:\n\n1. Honesty: Honesty is a fundamental value in many cultures and is essential for building trust and respect in personal and professional relationships. Telling the truth can prevent misunderstandings, save time, and avoid unnecessary conflict. However, there are situations where honesty might need to be tempered with tact and sensitivity to avoid causing harm or offense.\n\n2. Politeness: Politeness is also important as it helps to create a positive and respectful atmosphere in interactions. Politeness can help to avoid conflict, show respect for others, and build goodwill. However, excessive politeness can sometimes be used as a way to avoid being honest or to hide the truth.\n\nIn general, a balance between honesty and politeness is the best approach. It's important to be honest and truthful, but also to consider the timing, context, and impact of the message. Here are some tips for achieving this balance:\n\n- Be honest, but also consider the recipient's feelings and sensitivities.\n- Use tact and sensitivity when delivering difficult or unpleasant news.\n- Be clear and direct, but avoid being blunt or rude.\n- Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and feelings, rather than making accusatory statements that can come across as aggressive or confrontational.\n- Be open to feedback and willing to listen to others' perspectives and concerns.\n\nUltimately, the key is to be authentic, respectful, and considerate in your interactions, and to strive to find a balance between honesty and politeness that works for all parties involved."

          "question": "What are European values as opposed to values elsewhere? ",
          "answer": "European values are a set of cultural, social, and political principles that have evolved over time and are often associated with the continent of Europe. These values are not unique to Europe, but they have been shaped by the region's history, geography, and cultural exchanges. Here are some key European values:\n\n1. Democracy and Rule of Law: The principle of democracy, where power is held by the people or their elected representatives, is a fundamental value in many European countries. The rule of law, which ensures that all individuals and institutions are subject to the law, is also a cornerstone of European values.\n\n2. Human Rights: The protection and promotion of human rights are deeply ingrained in European culture. The European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrines a wide range of rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, and equality before the law.\n\n3. Individual Freedom: European cultures place a strong emphasis on individual freedom and autonomy. This includes the right to make personal choices, to express one's opinions, and to practice one's religion.\n\n4. Tolerance and Diversity: Europe has a long history of cultural and religious diversity, and this has fostered a culture of tolerance and acceptance. European values emphasize the importance of respecting and celebrating differences.\n\n5. Social Welfare: Many European countries have a strong tradition of social welfare, with a commitment to providing a safety net for the most vulnerable members of society. This includes access to healthcare, education, and social security.\n\n6. Environmental Protection: Europe has been at the forefront of environmental protection, with many countries having strong regulations and policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and preserving natural resources.\n\nIt's important to note that these values are not exclusive to Europe and can be found in other parts of the world. However, the specific ways in which these values are expressed and prioritized can vary significantly between different cultures and regions.\n\nIn contrast to European values, other regions or cultures may place a different emphasis on certain values. For example:\n\n- In some Asian cultures, the value of collective harmony and the importance of maintaining social order may take precedence over individual freedom.\n- In some African cultures, the value of community and the importance of taking care of one's elders may be more strongly emphasized.\n- In some Middle Eastern cultures, the value of family and the importance of respecting tradition may be more highly valued.\n\nIt's important to recognize and respect the diversity of values that exist around the world, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about the values of any particular culture or region."

          "question": "Which of the following societal values is most important? Rank them with the most important first: [individual freedom, promotion of industry, support for creativity, safety,equality,law and order]",
          "answer": "It's important to note that the importance of societal values can vary greatly depending on cultural, historical, and individual perspectives. However, many modern societies often prioritize certain values over others based on their principles and goals. Here's a ranking based on common global values, though it's essential to recognize that these can vary:\n\n1. **Safety** - Safety is often considered a fundamental value as it directly impacts the well-being and security of individuals within a society. Ensuring safety can encompass a wide range of measures, from public health and safety regulations to law enforcement and emergency services.\n\n2. **Law and Order** - The rule of law and maintaining order are crucial for the stability and predictability of a society. They provide a framework for resolving disputes and protecting individual rights, which is essential for social cohesion and economic prosperity.\n\n3. **Equality** - Promoting equality is important for ensuring that all members of society have the same opportunities and rights. This can include efforts to combat discrimination and ensure fairness in access to education, employment, and other resources.\n\nWhile the above three values are often considered foundational, the ranking of the other values can depend on specific societal goals and priorities:\n\n- **Individual Freedom** is highly valued in many democratic societies as it allows individuals to make choices and express themselves without undue restriction, fostering creativity and innovation.\n\n- **Support for Creativity** and **Promotion of Industry** are also important, as they can drive economic growth, innovation, and cultural development. However, their ranking can vary depending on whether a society prioritizes economic development over other goals.\n\nIt's important to remember that these values are not mutually exclusive, and a well-functioning society often balances them in a way that supports the well-being of its citizens. The specific ranking can vary significantly based on the cultural, economic, and political context of a society."

          "answer": "When hosting a visitor from Korea in England, there are several aspects that might cause confusion or require explanation:\n\n1. **Cultural Differences:**\n   - **Personal Space:** Koreans tend to value personal space more than people from the UK, which can lead to discomfort if physical contact is more common in social interactions.\n   - **Mealtimes:** The concept of \"tea time\" (around 4 pm) is a significant part of British culture, but it may not be as widely observed in modern times. Additionally, the idea of a large breakfast and a light lunch might be unfamiliar.\n   - **Formality:** The UK is generally a formal society, with formal greetings and titles used until invited to use first names. This can be a significant cultural difference for Koreans, who may be more inclined to use first names immediately.\n\n2. **Language:**\n   - **Accent and Slang:** British English has a wide range of accents and colloquial expressions that can be difficult for non-native speakers to understand. It's a good idea to speak clearly and avoid using slang or idioms that might not be familiar.\n   - **Food Labels:** Food packaging often uses local terms or abbreviations for ingredients. It might be helpful to explain what certain ingredients are or to provide translations for common food items.\n\n3. **Practical Considerations:**\n   - **Weather:** The UK's weather can be unpredictable, with frequent rain showers, even in the summer. It's a good idea to prepare for all conditions with appropriate clothing.\n   - **Public Transportation:** The UK's public transportation system can be complex, with different types of buses, trains, and schedules. It might be helpful to provide a guide or a map of the local transport system.\n   - **Electricity and Plugs:** The UK uses a different type of plug and voltage (230V, 50Hz) than Korea (220V, 60Hz). It's a good idea to have an adapter available for electronic devices.\n\n4. **Technology:**\n   - **Mobile Data and Roaming:** The cost of roaming can be high in the UK, so it's a good idea to let your visitor know about local data plans or Wi-Fi options.\n   - **Payment Methods:** Contactless payments are common in the UK, but not all visitors may be familiar with this method. It's a good idea to explain how contactless payments work and to have cash available for situations where contactless payments are not possible.\n\n5. **Safety:**\n   - **Crime Rates:** While the UK is generally a safe country, it's always a good idea to let your visitor know about local crime rates and to advise them on how to stay safe.\n   - **Emergency Services:** It's a good idea to provide your visitor with the contact information for emergency services, such as the police and the ambulance service.\n\nBy being aware of these potential areas of confusion, you can help make your visitor's stay in England more comfortable and enjoyable."
